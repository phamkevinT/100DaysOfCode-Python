## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

# Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

difference_percentage = (closing_price_difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100
print(difference_percentage)

# If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
if difference_percentage > 1:

    news_response = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_params)
    articles = news_response.json()["articles"]
    print(articles)

## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/

# Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
# See line 44-52

# Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
"""
